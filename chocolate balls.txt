    3/4 cup pitted dates (I like Sunmaid, because they’re softer) (120g)
    1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
    1/16 tsp salt
    2 tbsp cocoa or cacao powder
    2 tbsp shredded coconut
    1/3 to 1/2 cup raw pecans
    optional: feel free to add some chocolate chips

Blend all ingredients together very well. (I recommend using a food processor for best results, as they’ll be very sticky in a blender.) Squish the dough together – I transferred the dough to a plastic bag then smushed it together in the bag. It’s much less messy this way! Roll into balls, cookie-cuttered shapes, or bars… or you can even use it for a pie crust!
